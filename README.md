wfview supports modern and vintage radios using the CI-V protocol. Core features include a visual display of the waterfall data, simple point-and-click operation, basic type-and-send CW, and remote operation over wifi and Ethernet. For advanced users, wfview can also operate as a radio server, enabling remote access to USB-connected radios like the IC-7300. wfview allows other programs, such as logging and digital mode applications, to share control of the radio. 

wfview is unique in the radio control ecosystem in that it is free and open-source software and can take advantage of modern radio features (such as the waterfall). wfview also does not "eat the serial port", and can allow a second program, such as fldigi, access to the radio via a pseudo-terminal device.
